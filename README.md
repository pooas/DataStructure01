### Introduction
Welcome to the Data Structures Practice repository! Here you will find implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. This project is ideal for students, developers, or anyone looking to enhance their understanding and implementation skills of data structures.

### Folder Structure
- **/arrays**: Contains implementations of array data structures.
- **/linked_lists**: Contains implementations of linked list data structures.
- **/stacks**: Contains implementations of stack data structures.
- **/queues**: Contains implementations of queue data structures.
- **/trees**: Contains implementations of tree data structures.
- **/graphs**: Contains implementations of graph data structures.
- **/utils**: Utility functions used across different data structures.

### Data Structures Included
1. Array
2. Linked List (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)
3. Stack (Using Array, Using Linked List)
4. Queue (Using Array, Using Linked List)
5. Binary Search Tree
6. Graph (Directed Graph, Undirected Graph)

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired data structure folder.
3. I use C/C++ language.
4. Run the respective file containing the implementation.
5. Test the functionality with sample inputs and explore the code.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or new data structure implementations to add, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/add-new-data-structure`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new data structure'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/add-new-data-structure`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.
